Liv2Train - Training Center Registry

This is the MVP for the **Liv2Train** project, a Spring Boot application to manage the registry of government-funded training centers. It provides two REST APIs to create and retrieve training center information, using **MongoDB** as the database.

Features

- **POST API** to create a new training center with validation
- **GET API** to fetch all registered training centers
- Data persistence in **MongoDB**
- **Validation** for mandatory fields like email, phone, and others

Prerequisites

1. **Java 11+** installed
2. **Maven** installed
3. **MongoDB** running locally or remotely (default is localhost:27017)
4. **Postman/Curl** or any API testing tool to test the APIs

Setup

Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/liv2train.git
cd liv2train

Step 2: Configure MongoDB
In src/main/resources/application.properties, ensure the MongoDB URI is correct:
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/liv2train
If your MongoDB is hosted remotely, update the URI accordingly.

Step 3: Build and Run the Project
Use Maven to build the project and run the Spring Boot application:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Alternatively, you can run it from your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) by running the Liv2TrainApplication.java class.

Step 4: Verify the Application
The Spring Boot application will run by default on http://localhost:8081.
